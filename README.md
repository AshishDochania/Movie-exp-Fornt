### Back-End
first I started with setting up the API for getting the data.
As I was supposed to get 2 types of data, one was a list of movies based on a name typed and other was the details about a movie when clicked on it.

### Front-End
After this I started preparing my frontend to display that data coming from the backend.

### Technologies Used
React.js , Node.js , and Express.js
